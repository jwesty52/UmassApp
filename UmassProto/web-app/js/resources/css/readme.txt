DON'T customize this CSS file - it is auto-generated and contains all of the ExtJS styles as well as some custom mix-ins.

Instead, either:

+ Add custom classes, icons, styles, etc in ../../css/umassProto.css
+ Modify ../sass/umassProto.scss if you want to change core Ext styles and re-compile with Compass.

See the Sencha theming docs (http://docs.sencha.com/ext-js/4-0/#/guide/theming) for details.
